                                <p>We are a married couple with two young children, and full-time jobs in international
                                    health and public service. We are passionate about board games, art, culture, and
                                    crypto, but the strength and depth of the NFT community amazes us each and every
                                    day. Weâ€™ve joined forces with an amazing artist passionate about anime and comic
                                    books to create our first series of NFTs based on the classic board game Clue
                                    (Cluedo).

                                    Our vision is to bridge the social experience of board games with the
